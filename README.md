-  Hi, I’m @SCsharma
- Cultivating on statistics and conventional AI models.
- Currently working on data analysis and building machine learning models. Surface fitting for exponential functions is a complex operation. Multi-lane roads can be a solution to the mentioned problem. 
- Interpolation and Extrapolation are a tuple of paradoxes. To determine the unknown or to determine the probable? Seems to me escaping from deterministic human nature is a bit hard. Why so philosophic? Because every application starts with one.
